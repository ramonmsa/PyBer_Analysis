# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Project
Pyber CEO has requested the following tasks in order to support in decision-making.

1.  Create a summary Data Frame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
2.  Create a multiple-line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type.


### Purpose

To summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

The analysis of the ride-sharing data shows that:

- __*The number of rides*__ distribution are: 
	- The total of __*125 rides*__ in __*Rural*__ city type.
	- The total of __*625 rides*__ in __*Suburban*__ city type.
	- The total of __*1,625 rides*__ in __*Urban*__ city type.
- __*The quantity of drivers*__ observed are:
	-  The number of __*78*__  in __*Rural*__ areas.
	-  The number of __*490*__ in __*Suburban*__ areas
	- The number of __*2,405 drivers*__ in __*Urban*__ areas. 
- __*The total fares*__ collected per city types  are:
	-  The sum of __*$4,327.93 dollars*__ in __*Rural*__ ares.
	- The sum of  __*$19,356.33 dollars*__ in __*Suburban*__ areas.
	-  The sum of __*$39,854.38 dollars*__ in __*Urban*__ areas. 
- __*The average fare per ride*__ calculated are:
	- The amount of __*$34.62 dollars*__ in __*Rural*__ cities.
	- The amount of __*$30.97 dollars*__ in __*Suburban*__ cities.
	- The amount of __*$24.53 dollars*__ in __*Urban*__ cities.
-  __*The average fare per driver*__ computed are:
	- The amount of __*$55.49 dollars*__ in __*Rural *__ areas.
	- The amount of  __*$39.50 dollars*__ in __*Suburban*__ areas.
	- The amount of  __*$16.57 dollars*__ in __*Urban*__ areas. 


## Analysis

As it is shown on the Pyber data Summary per City Type image, Urban areas had by far the greatest demand for rides but also an excessive offer of drivers (1,625 rides and 2405 drivers). Consequently, the biggest amount of  fare is also observed in Urban cities  with  about $40K which represents the majority of Pyber's revenue observed in the summary.  

Theses numbers contrast with about only $4K made in Rural cities where the offer of drivers were only 78 to handle a total of 125 rides requested by PyBer's clients. 

Theses disparities reflect directly on the average fare per ride having values as high as $35.62 paid per ride in Rural areas making the service unattractive in those regions.  Ever more, the average fare per drivers is as low as $16.57 pushing down the drivers rates from the gains.

By observing the PyBer Fare Summary by City Type chart, it is noticeable that there is a slight variation of the fares through the moths for each city type how ever the fares tend to be about median value with Urban fares figuring  number per week of around $2,000 and over and Rural fares under $500 per week.

## Summary

 Based on the results recommend the following:
 - Consider to sum efforts to attract more clients and consequently more rides for the Suburban and Rural areas by offering promotional codes or discounts.
 - Consider to encourage drivers from urban areas to take rides from city types with more ride demand than offers by advertising higher shares in the gains.
 - Consider to start a campaign to hirer new drivers in Suburban and Rural cities.
